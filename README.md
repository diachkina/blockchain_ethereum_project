The original size of the crypto-ethereum.transactions dataset was 650,000,000 rows. 
Out of those, the data I needed accounted for 25,000,000 rows. 
A random sample of 1% was taken for the analysis, and then the first 20,000 rows were selected from it.

To verify the adequacy of the sample, the number of nulls and zero-value transactions were calculated. 
The values matched within a margin of error of 0.5%.
